# sqlserver-pipeline-framework

This git repository acts as a template for new SQL Server projects.

## Usage

Clone this repository and run the "Create Git Repo from Template.ps1" file from a powershell terminal.

You will be prompted for a name of a new repository and it will copy itself over there and replace all template references to your new chosen name.

After that, inside your new repo, you need to run the "bootstrap.ps1" script to make sure you have the required powershell modules and other settings in your projects to be able to start.

Lastly, if you want to run SQL Server on docker, it would help your if you ran the "example - write settings file.ps1" script to write your dev environment file that will store the password for your sa account on your sql server environment on docker.
